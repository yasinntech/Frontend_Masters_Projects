    <h1 class="title">About Me</h1>
    <p class="text">
        I am a 1st year student studying Software Engineering. My passion for software started in high school and I have
        been developing myself ever since. I am working on projects in the field of Web Development.

        I am eager to improve my problem solving skills and learn new technologies. I continue to improve myself by
        contributing to Open Source Projects and participating in Hackathons.
