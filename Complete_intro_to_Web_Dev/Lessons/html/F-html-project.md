Here is your first HTML project!

We're making your personal blog. Feel free to use the project we started in the last lesson. Here are your requirements

- Your blog has two pages: index.html and about.html
- Your index.html needs a title and a quick intro.
- Your index also needs a link to about.html.
- You blog must have five posts on it (you can just keep it all on the same page).
- Each post needs:
  - A title
  - An author
  - The date it was posted (feel free to make up times)
  - The text of the blog post. Bonus points if there are multiple paragraphs. Feel free to use [Lorem Ipsum][lorem] if you want placeholder text.
  - Bonus points for images.
- Your about.html needs
  - The name of your blog
  - A few paragraphs about you
  - A list of your recent jobs/schools/accomplishments
